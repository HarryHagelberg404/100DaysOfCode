# Hangman psuedo code:
# Generate a random word
# Generate as many blanks as letters in the word
# The user guesses a letter
# Is the guessed letter in the word? Yes / No

# Y Replace the blank with the letter
# Y Are all blanks filled?
#   Y GAME OVER
#   N The user keeps guessing

# N Lose a life
# N Have the user run out of lives?
#   Y GAME OVER
#   N The user keeps guessing
