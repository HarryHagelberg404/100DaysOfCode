## Day 1 - 10 of 100 days of code

### Day 1. Band-Name-Generator

The startup of the challenge. Became familiraized in printing and retrieving input in from the terminal. This challenge was not difficult but it was nice to get a refresher in python.

### Day 2. Restaurant-Tipper

The second day and I'm eager to learn more python. I've heard of the broad possibilities and I want to master the language. Today I created a script that calculate the total sum each person of a party should pay given different percentages of tip given as input by the user. Today I became familiar with mathematical operations as well as converting numbers to different data-types such as integers or floats. I'm ready for tomorrow.

### Day 3. Treasure-Island

Got familiar with comparision operators as well as managing a control flow with conditional operators. In an excersize i came in touch with the modulo operator and checking if a number is even or odd. Today I also came in touch with the "and", "or" when comparing inte control structures. Nested if statements in python was quite a mess when coming from a language that uses brackets for intendation.
