# 100DaysOfCode

A challenge supposed to enhance my skills in python as well as to improve my continuity of writing code more often

I have divided the 100 days into 4 different milestones and will document my thoughts as well as what I've learnt.

## Preasumptions

I assume that the 100 days of code challenge is hard because of the continuity that's required of you. The most important key to succeeding and overcoming the challenge I assume is to keep going, not because you have to, but because it's fun to learn, improve and enhance existing skills. I'm excited to start learning and especially the powerful possibilities of Python. I make the assumption that a total of 1 - 2 hours will be spent each day.

And most importantly, NO DAYS OFF.

### 25 days of code

### 50 days of code

### 75 days of code

### 100 days of code

## Final thoughts

### What I've learnt

### What I want to investigate and develop further

### What I thought was fun

### Would I recommend the challenge to a fellow developer?
